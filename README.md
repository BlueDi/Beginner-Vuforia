# Beginner Vuforia
In this project you'll find 3 mini-projects that will help you start learning Vuforia with Unity.

### Weather Board
Here you can understand how to make external api calls and change the object based on the result of the call.

### Video Player
An example on how to collide Vuforia image targets and how to use the VideoPlayer class of Unity.

### Pop the Balloon
The classic game of shooting balloons will teach you how to make the Vuforia targets interact with buttons and destroy objects from afar. It also gives an example of an undo button.
